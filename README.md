# let-s-planting-website

The presence of plants is essential in our lives!
That is why we built this Website that targets those interested in plants.

On this Website, you can find many functionalities. It provides useful information on taking care of the various types of plants 
and the problems that any planter may encounter. Also a page for the farmersâ€™ community for easy access to farmers and to gain experience from them.
In addition, it delivers an opportunity to donate to agriculture in areas that lack plants.

This site was built using several programming languages: javascript, HTML and CSS.
