      there are different opinions of the best time of the year to grow a tree, alot of people think that spring is the ideal month for planting because all plants recovers from winter coldness and start growing again. but ther are actually another factors to take in mind that effects the growth of tree and help it thrives. things like the region you live in, for region that have consistent weather there are no preferrred timing. but for those who experence seasons fall is the perfect time to grow a tree. because unlike spring that followed by summer heat, fall provides extra time for trees to establish their roots in cooler temperatures.

   <img src="https://f.top4top.io/p_24924k4zq3.jpg",width="250", height="200" class="i">
    Sunlight is one of the most important factors in planting trees for so many reasons. because in order for trees to perform photosynthesis it requires amount of sunlight. and in the absence of light trees will die, so it's important to place your tree in a site that matches it needed amount of sunlight. Otherwise problems like leaves dropping and loosing their green color will appear, while trying to provide the needed light for you tree, make sure that you're not over-exposuring it to the sun because its only a matter of time then problems like burning the tree leaves and damaging the bark will happens. 
   </p>
     <p>
      <big> Type of Soil:</big><br>
      <img src="https://h.top4top.io/p_24928bgwd5.jpg",width="250", height="200" class="i">
      Type of soil plays a huge impact in trees growing. using a wrong soil can lead to many proplems such as constricting the root from accessing the water, and root as we know are the base of the tree that if it was weak and lack any nutrients, it'll be hard for tree to thrive, also the leaf will discolorate, and the tree growth will stunted. So, you have to make sure you're goin with the right soil type for your tree. when different trees requires different type of soil, there are common facilities that must be in any soil you have choose to select, such as containing alot of organic matter, nutrients and water.

      <img src="https://i.top4top.io/p_2492y9jub6.jpg", width="250", height="200" class="i">
       Like all living creatures, trees need watering in order to live and thrive. but we need to recognize that both watering you tree too much or too little can be harmful, so make sure you're only providing your tree with its needed amount of water. its not hard to tell when you're miswatering a tree, there are clear signs trees gives us both when its overwatered or not getting enough water. like yellowing-dropping leaves, and so on. However, watering trees vary from one to another, for young trees its better to be watered oftentimes so their root can grow strong. and for mature trees, 1-2 times a month works just fine.

      <img src="https://j.top4top.io/p_2492f1vey7.jpg", width="250", height="200" class="i">
      sometimes trees shows a damaging effects like dead leaves, dormant stems, and brown parts of leaves, that are usually caused by overexposuring to the sun or strong winds. its essential to remove those dead parts out of your tree as soon as they starts to appear. Because those dead branches slowly consumes your tree by leaching the important nutrients from the tree that are better used else where in the healthy-parts. and by removing them you're allowing the nutrients to go where it needed most which will help you tree remaining healthy and encourages new growth.

      <img src="https://d.top4top.io/p_2492v73i91.jpeg", width="250", height="200" class="i">
      as soon as autumn arrives, tree leaves start turning into shades of gold making up a beautiful scene caused by the chlorophyll breaks down and not sign of tree dying as many thinks. however, taking care of tree at this time is not complicated, you should allows it to enter their transitional phase smoothly. when the leaves falls, put some organic compost mulch around your tree to help it retaining water and reducing temperature extremes. you can also prevent the weather-damage on your tree by wrapping it using plastic guard or metal hardware. fall is also just might be the perfect time for you to prune your tree!
